//     The taxes are 20% of each part's price you receive.
// If the customer is special, he has a 10% discount on the total price with taxes.
// If a given price is not a positive number, you should print "Invalid price!" on the console and continue with the next price.
// If the total price is equal to zero, you should print "Invalid order!" on the console.
// â€¢	The receipt should be in the following format:
// "Congratulations you've just bought a new computer!
// Price without taxes: {total price without taxes}$
// Taxes: {total amount of taxes}$
// -----------
// Total price: {total price with taxes}$"
// Note: All prices should be displayed to the second digit after the decimal point! The discount is applied only on the total price. Discount is only applicable to the final price!
