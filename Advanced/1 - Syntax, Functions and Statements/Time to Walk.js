// •	The first is the number of steps the student takes from their home to the university
// •	Тhe second number is the length of the student's footprint in meters
// •	Тhe third number is the student speed in km/h
// Every 500 meters the student rests and takes a 1 minute break.
// Calculate how long the student walks from home to university and print on the console the result in the following format: 'hours:minutes:seconds'.
